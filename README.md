# EEG-Epilepsy
**Introduction**: Epilepsy is a disease characterized by an excessive discharge in neurons generally provoked without any external stimulus, known as convulsions. In the world, about 2 million people are diagnosed each year, this process is car-
ried out by a neurological doctor using an electroencephalogram (EEG), making it a lengthy process.
**Method**: To optimize these processes and make them more efficient, we have resorted to innovative artificial intelligence methods essential in classifying EEG signals. For this, comparing traditional models, such as machine learning or deep
learning, with cutting-edge models, in this case, using Capsule-Net architectures and Transformer Encoder, has a crucial role in finding the most accurate model and helping the doctor to have a faster diagnosis.
**Result**: In this paper, a comparison was made between different models for binary and multiclass classification of the epileptic seizure detection database achieving a binary accuracy of 99.92% with the Capsule-Net model and a multiclass accuracy with the Transformer Encoder model of 87.30%.
